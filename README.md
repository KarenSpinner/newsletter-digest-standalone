## Installation

### Prerequisites

### Setup

1. **Create a CSV file with your newsletter subscriptions:**

   Create a file named `my_newsletters.csv` with the following format:

   ```csv

   The Generalist,https://thegeneralist.substack.com,Business,
   Stratechery,https://stratechery.com,Technology,
   Not Boring,https://notboring.substack.com,Business,Tech Favorites
   ```

   **Required fields:**
   - `Newsletter Name` - The name of the newsletter

   **Optional fields:**
   - `Category` - For grouping articles (defaults to "Uncategorized")

   **Note:** Currently only supports Substack newsletters with public RSS feeds.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

That's it! You're ready to go.

## Usage

### Run the generator:
```bash
python digest_generator.py
```

### Interactive prompts:

You'll be asked:

1. **CSV file path** (default: `my_newsletters.csv`)
   - Just press Enter if the file is in the same directory

2. **Days back** (default: 7)
   - How far back to look for articles
   - 7 days = weekly digest
   - 14 days = bi-weekly digest

3. **Featured articles** (default: 5)
   - Number of top articles to highlight
   - 3-7 is typical

4. **Include wildcard?** (default: yes)
   - Adds a random "hidden gem" from next 10 articles
   - Makes digest more interesting!

5. **Output filename** (default: `digest_output.html`)
   - Name of the HTML file to save

========================================
```

## Output Format

The digest includes:

### ✨ Featured Articles
Top-scored articles with:
- Numbered list (1, 2, 3...)
- Full title with link
- Newsletter name
- Engagement stats (comments, likes, restacks)
- Days since publication
- Article summary
- Daily Average Score

### 🎲 Wildcard Pick (optional)
A random article from the next 10 highest-scored articles - helps surface hidden gems!

### 📂 Categorized Sections
Remaining articles grouped by category:
- Business
- Technology
- Culture
- etc.

Each article shows:
- Title with link
- Newsletter name
- Engagement stats
- Days since publication

## How It Works

### Data Sources
1. **RSS Feeds** - Gets article titles, links, dates (public, no auth)
2. **Substack API** - Gets engagement metrics via public endpoints like:
   ```
   https://newsletter.substack.com/api/v1/posts/slug
   ```
   Returns: `comment_count`, `reactions`, `restacks`

### Scoring Algorithm (Daily Average)

```python
total_engagement = (comments × 2) + likes + (restacks × 3)
daily_average = total_engagement / days_since_publication
score = daily_average × (1 + length_bonus)
```

**Why Daily Average?**
- Rewards consistent quality over viral spikes
- Newer articles compete fairly with older ones
- Prevents recency bias
- Highlights evergreen content

**Weights:**
- Comments: 2× (high-signal engagement)
- Likes: 1×
- Restacks: 3× (highest-signal - someone shared it!)
- Length bonus: +20% for 1000+ words, +10% for 500+ words

## Troubleshooting

### "CSV file not found"
- Make sure `my_newsletters.csv` is in the same directory
- Or provide the full path when prompted

### "No articles found"
- Try increasing the lookback period (14 or 21 days)
- Some newsletters publish infrequently
- Check that CSV has valid Substack URLs

### "HTTP errors" during fetch
- Some newsletters may be temporarily down
- Script will skip and continue with others
- Normal to see a few failures in large lists

### Engagement metrics are zero
- Substack may rate-limit public API calls
- Articles are still included, just missing metrics
- Try running again in a few minutes

## Customization

You can edit `digest_generator.py` to customize:

### Engagement weights (line ~200):
```python
total_engagement = (
    (article['comment_count'] * 2) +  # Change comment weight
    article['reaction_count'] +       # Change like weight
    (article['restacks'] * 3)         # Change restack weight
)
```

### HTML styling (line ~300+):
- Font sizes
- Colors
- Spacing
- Border styles

### Article limits:
- Featured count (CLI prompt)
- Articles per category (line ~350): `articles[:10]`
